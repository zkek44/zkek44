### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a 3rd year graduate student at the University of Colorado, Boulder where I will graduate with an MS in Data Science. Starting out as a jazz saxophone major at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, I took a big risk by transferring schools and switching majors after realizing that a life of music did not align with my personal goals or happiness. Now that I am in a program that I thoroughly enjoy, it has made me even more passionate about achieving success in my career! I love working with numbers, big data, and learning about business functionality. In my free time I enjoy golfing, watching sports, and spending quality time with friends and family!
